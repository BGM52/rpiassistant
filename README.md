# rpiassistant
This is a Python GUI for the Raspberry Pi that will (eventually) function as a digital assistant. (See Portal by Facebook or Nest Hub) This is only the code, but instructions on how to build one will come eventually.

Note: This is still very much under development and many features are not yet fully fleshed out.
